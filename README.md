# creit_scroing_with_neural_networks
In this project, we are solving the problem of credit risk. We are predicting that whether the customer will pay back the loan or not. Based on the previous data, we have trained machine learning and deep learning models to do so and achived 91%(approx) accuracy on testing set.


We have trained 3 different kind of models on the data.

Logistic Regression
RandomForest Classifier
Neural Network with 3 hidden layers.
Most of the time the accuracy on the testing set was around 91% for all the 3 models. Accuracy can be increased by tunning the models properly, but for now we are using them as defualt.
